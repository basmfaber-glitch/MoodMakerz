MoodMarket — Affiliate Mapping

Files:
- index.html: site
- manifest.json: PWA manifest
- catalog.json: full 50-item list per mood
- affiliate_links.csv: template to paste your affiliate links and (optional) image URLs

How to add affiliate links:
1) Open affiliate_links.csv
2) Fill affiliate_url for each mood+title row
3) (Optional) fill image_url to override the automatic Unsplash image
4) Tell me the filled CSV and I can update index.html to load your exact links/images.

Note on images:
- The site currently uses Unsplash Source by query based on (title + mood).
- If you prefer exact images, fill image_url in the CSV and we can wire it in.
